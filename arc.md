3. Data Retention/Deposit/Preservation: 23% of researchers who sought support went to ARC

_Top 3 areas in which researchers **sought training from ARC** (Figure X for full details)_

1. High-Performance Computing: 35% of researchers who sought training went to ARC
2. Coding/Programming:  15% of researches who sought training went to ARC
3. Cloud Computing:  23% of researches who sought training went to ARC

### Key Findings

**Finding 1**: The majority of researchers wanted training and support but didnâ€™t know they were available;

**Recommendation 1**: Coordinate and strategize communications across portfolios and departments to ensure that researchers are able to easily discover and access services;

**Finding 2**: For every element of DRI investigated, training and support were sought across multiple portfolios and departments, as well as outside of UBC;

**Recommendation 2**: Coordinate services with portfolios and departments that offer similar services to maximize efforts and reduce duplication;

**Finding 3**: Participants in focus groups noted that finding the right service is challenging;

**Recommendation 3**: Coordinate across portfolios and departments that provide DRI services to build a central portal for the easy discovery of services;
