## Data Availability

Survey responses were collected anonymously, except where participants could enter an email address to enter a draw or participate in focus groups. Any potentially identifying data points from both the survey--including emails, geolocation, and survey dissemination channel--and focus groups were removed before analysis. All data used for analysis is available at [address]. 

## Introduction  

Within the academic research environment there is an ever-increasing need for substantive digital research infrastructure (DRI), at both the national and institutional levels.  DRI refers to a suite of services that enables the collection, processing, dissemination and disposition of research data. In practice this is the software, code, large-scale computational facilities, and data storage facilities required in the research data lifecycle[^1].  While academic researchers have historically compiled, analyzed, and temporarily stored data, the growth in the technology and capacity to obtain large data sets, and the requirements to share data indefinitely, have radically changed the needs for services, support, and training for the research community. 

The University of British Columbia (UBC) has invested significantly in DRI, with over $26 million a year in operating expenses for research excellence, which includes DRI, in order to promote and enhance these services across both Vancouver and Okanagan campuses as well as affiliated research institutes and hospitals. Two units that are fundamental in providing these services are UBC Advanced Research Computing (UBC ARC) and UBC Library. UBC ARC and UBC Library partnered in 2021 to assess current training and support services offered across several elements of DRI at UBC through a needs assessment survey and focus groups. The objective of this DRI Needs Assessment was to conduct a substantive review of current DRI training and support utilized by UBC researchers. 

This report provides a summary of the findings and related recommendations to address identified gaps and encourage further utilization of the UBC DRI investment. 

## Background

As traditionally non-computational disciplines increasingly rely on digital methodologies or approaches, and computationally-centric disciplines need to navigate large and complex computational environments, there is a growing and widespread need to support the infrastructural demands of these research projects as well as to ensure that practitioners have the skillsets required to engage in these activities. 

Research intensive universities must invest in advanced research computing facilities, research data management services, data storage services and training, research software licenses and development, and highly qualified personnel to support this infrastructure if they wish to be competitive. This need is as much predicated on providing the necessary frameworks to enable research as it is to entice top tier researchers; prospective faculty increasingly inquire about this kind of investment, and more universities are offering cloud credits and support as ways to entice candidates. 

Access to, and support with, growing amounts of data is central to today‚Äôs research. ‚ÄúIn the academic world, faculty understand this better than anyone because their careers hinge on publishing research in scholarly journals. Standing between every researcher and peer-reviewed publication, however, are mountains of messy logistics that must be removed to focus on what really matters: first-rate research design and analysis‚Äù[^5].  

UBC has recognized this is an area where financial and resource investment is required.  Substantive contributions have been made to advanced research compute infrastructure, including the hiring of new and re-imagining of existing positions in UBC ARC and UBC Library to support RDM, data, and digital scholarship across a range of disciplines, and supporting in kind contributions by engaging in national and regional partnerships to address many of the underlying issues that span the scope or capacity of any individual institution. While UBC ARC and UBC Library have positioned themselves to lead the provisioning of services and support related to DRI at a campus level, this work is contributed to in significant ways by several units, departments, and faculty specific resources on both campuses, each often working in relative isolation one from the other. 

### UBC ARC

UBC ARC was formally launched in 2015. However, the infrastructure it maintains and provides to researchers is relatively new.‚ÄØ In 2019, UBC ARC Sockeye, a 15,872 CPU and 200 GPU high performance computing system available to UBC researchers was unveiled as a complement to the national computing services supported by The Digital Research Alliance of Canada/Compute Canada Federation.‚ÄØ In 2020, UBC ARC Chinook, a 20 petabyte object storage platform was subsequently launched.‚ÄØ Combined, Sockeye and Chinook were enabled through capital investments totaling over C$18 million6.‚ÄØ Often, advanced research computing (ARC) services are provided through a traditional IT department, with staff having various levels of research experience.‚ÄØIn contrast, UBC ARC is a multidisciplinary unit within the Office of the Vice President of Research and Innovation, comprised of staff members in traditional ARC roles such as system administrators, and former researchers, as well as less traditional members with backgrounds in areas such as health, oceanography, archeology, and library and information sciences. 

UBC ARC occupies a unique position at the intersection of high performance computing (HPC), research data management (RDM), and research software (RS), and leverages this position through collaboration with departments and portfolios spanning UBC to offer support and training across the range of DRI activities queried in this needs assessment.  Over the course of the last two years, UBC ARC staff have hosted a number of introductory courses on HPC, commercial cloud, and RDM.  

### UBC Library

As research outputs have grown to include not just journal articles and monographs, the role of the academic library is shifting. Two fundamental aspects of the academic library--development of and access to collections and training in information literacies--need to tackle and embrace managing digital objects, intermediary research objects, and critical literacies in using, navigating, and engaging with these materials. With this growth in digital outputs and the need for infrastructure that provides durable, accessible, and discoverable access, ‚Äúacademic libraries [...] face enormous changes in user expectations and information-seeking behaviour.‚Äù Like many institutions, UBC Library started hiring and cultivating expertise to address these expectations. Starting with a Research Data Management position in 2014, DRI related activities are now built directly into several positions that contribute to the campus community by developing digital research infrastructure resources for faculty, staff, and students. 

On the Vancouver campus, DRI activities such as RDM, tools for data visualization, statistical analysis, geospatial inquiries, and text analysis are supported by the Research Commons. On the Okanagan campus, the Centre for Scholarly Communication (CSC), launched in 2020, brings together expertise from the Library, Research Computing, and the Office of Research Services in a single portal to facilitate researcher access to training and support across the full scope of DRI activities queried in the needs assessment. 

UBC Library offers regular foundational workshops--supported by investments in people and spaces to host these events--funds and provides access to several research data repositories‚ÄîUBC Dataverse, FRDR, and Dryad--and invests in the development of institutional and national platforms that enable the operationalization of RDM mandates such as the DMP Assistant.   

### Campus

Within the UBC context, often the two campuses, UBC Vancouver and UBC Okanagan are evaluated separately.  For the purposes of this needs assessment, it is worth noting that the support services and training infrastructures vary between the two campuses. 

### National DRI

In a similar fashion to UBC‚Äôs DRI supports operating in isolation from each other, at a national level, historically DRI has been supported by three, distinct organizations--Compute Canada, Portage, and CANARIE--responsible respectively for ARC, RDM, and RS. Operating as specific and separate services, approaches to building competency and capacity in these areas have lacked overlap. In an effort to address this, the Government provided C$375 million in funding to consolidate these organizations; the subsequent launch of the Digital Research Alliance of Canada represents a momentous integration of these three components of DRI nationally[^7].   

Parallel to this needs assessment of UBC researchers, the Alliance conducted a similar survey at the national level, which will be discussed in relevant sections within this report. 

## Methodology

Data collection for the needs assessment consisted of (1) a survey assessing current usage, awareness, and gaps in research data, software, and computational services, and (2) three follow-up focus groups with questions informed by survey results. 

### Survey

The needs assessment survey was open from May 17 - June 12, 2021, and queried UBC researchers‚Äô training and support needs in 25 distinct areas relating to data, software, and computational infrastructure (Table 1). Open to all UBC researchers--graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty--the survey was distributed online through UBC Library and UBC ARC communication channels, university-wide newsletters, and targeted groups known to use at least a subset of these services. A total of 241 responses were received. 

For the purpose of the survey, training and support were looked at as distinct services, with ‚Äútraining‚Äù defined as "single workshops, workshop series, online modules/videos, and formal courses", and ‚Äúsupport‚Äù defined as "web resources, consultations, advising, troubleshooting, and recommendations". 

After entering demographic information, participants were presented with a list of 25 areas of DRI, and asked to select all those relevant to their research. Following this, each participant was asked to complete questions for each DRI element selected, including (1) whether they needed or wanted training/support, (2) if they sought training/support, and if so, (3) where they went and how satisfied they were with the training/support received. Participants were also given the option to submit free-text comments at the end of the survey.  For analysis, the 25 DRI elements were categorized into four groups, loosely based on their relationships with one another (Table 1).

### Focus Groups

As part of the survey, participants were asked if they would be willing to participate in a focus group. Of the 23 respondents who provided contact information, 11 were scheduled for and participated in three focus groups.  Focus groups were semi-structured, containing scripted questions but also allowing spontaneous follow-up and discussion. For each session, two members from the assessment team were present, with one person leading the discussion and the other taking notes. Sessions were conducted via Zoom, and were recorded as well as transcribed using Zoom's built-in software. Videos were deleted after transcripts were exported to a secure storage platform, and all transcripts were stripped of identifiers. While transcripts weren't formally coded or analyzed, excerpts of relevance were extracted. 

### Limitations

The DRI Needs Assessment Survey was designed to evaluate awareness of and need for support and training in DRI. While free text fields allowed for respondents to provide additional qualitative feedback, the bulk of the survey focused on what was sought or needed, and less on why or at what level or in what modality these training and supports were needed or not needed. While the focus groups allowed a deeper dive into these issues, the pool of focus group participants represents a sample biased by size, discipline, volunteer bias, and scheduling parameters. Consequently, while this survey is able to report on the degree of awareness of DRI supports and training and the degree to which DRI training and supports are used and from which units or departments, further inquiry would enhance our understanding of specific training and support needs, modalities of delivery, and access points to increase awareness. 

## Results

### Demographics

The survey began by asking demographic information about participants\' position at UBC, their discipline, as well as their primary work location at UBC. While Professors made up the largest group of respondents, there was strong representation across all groups except Instructors and Postdoctoral Fellows (Figure 1.1). In terms of research discipline, Medicine and Health Sciences, as well as the Social Sciences and Humanities made up a disproportionate number of respondents (Figure 1.2). The primary work location of respondents was largely the Vancouver campus, although there was significant representation from both the Okanagan campus as well as affiliated hospitals or institutions (Figure 1.3).

### Findings

For the purpose of this report, this section will feature the high-level findings from the full population of respondents. For more granular findings, see the [unit specific reports](index.html#unit-reports).   

### Awareness

One of the most striking findings from the survey was the discrepancy between the relatively small number of those that sought training or support, compared to the much larger numbers of those that would have liked training or support but didn\'t know they were available (Figures 1.4 and 1.5). Of particular note is that this gap between those that sought training or support versus those that wanted it spans across nearly all of the 25 DRI elements and the respective portfolios and departments that serve these areas.

### Dispersion of Support and Training

Another notable finding is that of the respondents that sought training or support, there was no single portfolio or department that unanimously served a particular area, but rather, all 25 areas of DRI were served by several different units (Figures 1.6). Furthermore, for those that did seek both support and training, many turned to sources outside of UBC for a variety of DRI areas.

### Training Within UBC

As mentioned above, a large number of respondents indicated that they sought training outside of UBC. However, one of the common themes across the focus groups was the desire for more training to be offered within UBC (Figure 1.7). As noted in these quotes, a big motivation for wanting internal training is that this encourages the growth of research communities and networks, for both faculty as well as graduate researchers.   

**Figure 1.7.  Focus Group Quotes Regarding Internal Training at UBC.**

> \"If [training] can occur here, you build up this kind of community of practice... and that support can help, and it gives people the opportunity to talk to others about what they\'re trying to [do and what] they're having trouble with.\"

> \"I always try to get [training] within UBC and be aligned with what you see [UBC] offering, because then it shows that I\'m trying to build the research network here and use the services and help them get better.\" 

> \"I can only see benefits in having training inside UBC.  Of course, you need to have the proper personnel to do that... but you know my first option will always look at UBC before looking outside, and I\'ll be very happy if I can find something.\"

> \"Empowering graduate students [to] seek out their own network and other graduate students within their institution is always really rewarding for everyone, [and] it usually leads to a lot of productivity.\"

### Regularly Offered/Asynchronus Training

In addition to the indicated desire for localized training, focus group participants also indicated that having training offered regularly throughout the year would be beneficial, as graduate students arrive throughout the year. In this same line of discussion, participants indicated that asynchronous or online training would be of value, as it would not only accommodate those who cannot make live training sessions, but is a beneficial supplement to live training.   

**Figure 1.8.  Focus Group Quotes Regarding the Frequency of Training Offerings**  

> \"It\'s easy when students all come in September, because we seem to be geared up in that time on this campus to put people through [training]. But when they show up in May, they\'ve missed much [of the training offered], so I think options that are online [would be helpful].\"

> \"Training would probably be useful [if] regularly offered. And I recognize the landscape is changing all the time, but that\'s why it needs to be regularly offered.\"
  
> \"I think having some ability to do asynchronous learning would facilitate students coming at different times and being able to go at their own pace‚Ä¶[and then would build] the ability to come with targeted questions.\"

> \"I like the little canvas modules... I think those are useful. I always advocate for them as ways to do training. And those paired with... regular drop in [sessions] it seems to me, would be really useful.\"

> \"I think that tutorial packages with examples are by far the best way [for me to learn] ... But I know that other people do have different needs and I think that having direct feedback and being able to ask a human being questions is useful for some people.\"
 
## Discussion and Next Steps

### Communicating Training and Support

The substantial number of respondents wanting training or support, but not knowing they are available, indicates that DRI services are not being effectively communicated to the research community. Of particular note is that there is not one single portfolio or area where this is prevalent, but rather, this seems to be a trend that spans the institution and all areas of DRI outlined in the survey. While there is no definitive explanation as to why current communication efforts may not be effective, these findings suggest that DRI resources across UBC may be underutilized due to a lack of researcher awareness. Acknowledging that this is an institutional issue, the subsequent next steps towards a solution should be considered at an institutional level. As almost all areas of DRI are served by multiple departments, a logical step would be to initiate a dialogue among these separate units, to begin teasing how they might collaborate and work towards a unified approach to the promotion and discoverability of DRI services at UBC.   

### Building a Centralized Data Portal

As a response to the upcoming Tri-Agency requirement of an RDM Institutional Strategy, UBC is currently and will continue to assess the maturity of its current capabilities to support RDM, as well as defining its ideal future state. Because the services involved in supporting RDM include all aspects of DRI, and the assessment will involve taking stock of all services, supports, and training that are currently offered at UBC, there is an opportunity to define an ideal state that would focus on the consolidation and centralization of DRI services. This type of future state would not only function in improving the visibility and discoverability of these services, but would also reduce duplicated efforts across the institution, resulting in a more efficient and effective use of resources. In practice, a centralized institutional data portal, that would be deployed and maintained by a group of members from multiple departments and portfolios, would be a fruitful and collaborative approach to maximizing our capabilities as an institution.

### Leveraging National Partnerships

In line with a future state of centralized DRI services within UBC, part of this dialogue should consider what types of training UBC is interested in and capable of providing internally, both currently and in an idea future state, and what training can be properly accommodated outside of UBC. While there are existing partnerships between UBC and Alliance Portage / Alliance Compute Canada, a potential area of inquiry would be to investigate how DRAC training could more formally be situated as a supplement to the training offered within UBC, both in terms of content and how all training opportunities are promoted and discovered among the UBC research community. Combining these efforts would broaden the availability of live (in-person and virtual) training, as well as asynchronous training and modules, providing more comprehensive and timely training opportunities for the UBC research community. This approach would also facilitate UBC in aligning with the national DRI landscape, foster stronger relationships between UBC and the DRAC community, as well as maximize resources on a national scale.
