With 13 branches spanning UBC Vancouver, Vancouver General Hospital, and UBC Okanagan, UBC Library supports a range of research activities in diverse and unique contexts. In the context of Digital Research Infrastructure, librarians work with local and national partners to develop access points to research, facilitate deposit of research data, and create training materials to enhance research practices in a digital environment. The library also develops collections and funds platforms that allow researchers to learn about and participate in digital research.

On the Vancouver campus, DRI activities in the realms of RDM, and tools for data visualization, statistical analysis, geospatial inquiries, and text analysis are supported by the Research Commons. On the Okanagan campus, the Centre for Scholarly Communication brings together expertise from the Library, Research Computing, and the Office of Research Services as a single portal to facilitate researcher access to training and support across the full scope of DRI activities queried in the DRI Needs Assessment survey.

## Key Findings & Recommendations

<div class="recommendation">
  <p><b>Finding 1</b></p>

  <p>Many respondents were either unaware of the RDM supports and training available from the lirbary and frequently looked outside the library for RDM supports and training.</p>

  <p><b>Recommendation 1</b></p> 

  <p>As a leader in RDM services with a dedicated RDM Librarian and an RDM Team that spans both campuses, alongside national partnerships, the library is in a strong position to support RDM. Investigation into why these supports and training are not on the radar of much of the research community suggests either a need to re-evaluate our communications strategy or increase partnerships where researchers are seeking supports.</p>

<div class="recommendation">
  <p><b>Finding 2</b></p>
  
    <p>UBC Library was frequently the least accessed unit for support across DRI supports and training.</p>

  <p><b>Recommendation 2</b></p>

  <p>UBC Library, in particular through the Research Commons, provides graduate level training and faculty support across a range of DRI activities, most notably in the realm of digital scholarship, GIS, RDM, and data analysis. Many of these are supported by higher level training and infrastrcuture support by ARC. There is strong potential growth in these offerings given the number of researchers either unaware of these supports or looking elsewhere on campus for support. At the same time, there is concern that the training provided by ARC is too advanced. There is particaulr opportunity to harmonize a continuity of training and support across a breadth of skill levels working more closely with ARC.</p>
