### Key Findings & Recommendations

**Finding 1:** A significant portion of respondents reported wanting training and support but didnâ€™t know they were available; 

**Recommendation 1:**  Coordinate and strategize communications across portfolios and departments to ensure that researchers are able to easily discover and access services; 


**Finding 2:**  For DRI areas in which researchers turned to IT for training and support, multiple other support groups, including those outside UBC, were also sought; 

**Recommendation 2:** Coordinate services with portfolios and departments that offer similar services to maximize efforts and reduce duplication; 


**Finding 3:** Participants in focus groups noted that finding the right service is challenging; 

**Recommendation 3:** Coordinate across portfolios and departments that provide DRI services to build a central portal for the easy discovery of services;
