## Load required packages
assuming they're already installed
  
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)
library(tidyr)
library(tidyselect)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)
library(forcats)
library(RColorBrewer)
```


## Import source files

  - DRI_survey_results_20210927.csv __(output as downloaded from Qualtrics with default export settings)__
  - DRI_survey_spam_ids.csv __(list of ResponseIDs previously identified as spam)__

```{r}
responses <- read.csv('../DRI_survey_results_20210927.csv')
spam <- read.csv('../DRI_survey_spam_ids.csv')
```

## Remove first two non-header rows
Qualtrics exports include three header rows; we only need the first *CAUTION: run only once; each time it runs the first two records of the `responses` dataframe are deleted.*

```{r}
responses <- slice(responses, -1:-2)
```

## Limit to responses where "finished" field = TRUE
Qualtrics records partial responses where the respondent never clicked submit; delete these

```{r}
responses <- responses %>%
  filter(Finished == "TRUE")
```

## Remove records identified as spam

```{r}
spam_removed <- anti_join(responses, spam, by="ResponseId" )
```

## Remove variables
Remove variables that aren't required for the graphs:

  - survey metadata (i.e. all variables that don't start with "Q#")
  - personal information (Q29, Q31, etc.)
  - variables with the same value in all responses (e.g. where *no one* provided a response)
  - "please specify" fields used by respondents who select "Other"

```{r}
variables_removed <- spam_removed %>%
  select(matches("^Q\\d")) %>%
  select(-(one_of("Q29","Q31","Q32_1","Q32_2"))) %>%
  select_if(~!n_distinct(.) < 2) %>%
  select(-matches("TEXT"))
```

## Add identifier variable (unique respondent ID not linked to Qualtrics)

```{r}
variables_removed <- rowid_to_column(variables_removed, var="id")
```

## Pivot from wide to long
The export from Qualtrics has one row per respondent, with columns for each question and for each *option* in "select all that apply" questions. Graphing is easier if the data is normalized with each question on its own row. In this process we also split some questions into two variables. For example, a case where the "SupportWhere_Machine learning" variable has a value of "UBC IT" will look like this:

  | variable name | value            |
  | ---           | ---              |
  | question      | SupportWhere     |
  | item          | Machine learning |
  | response      | UBC IT           |
  
### Step 1: Pivot 
```{r}
pivot <- variables_removed %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = matches("_"),
    names_to = "question",
    values_to = "response"
  )
```

### Step 2: Split
```{r}
pivot2 <- pivot %>%
  separate(question, c("question","item"),"_", remove = TRUE)
```

### Step 3: Rename values in new columns
```{r}
pivot3 <- pivot2 %>%
  mutate(question = case_when(
                        question == "Q18"   ~ "Support",
                        question == "Q19.1" ~ "SupportWhere",
                        question == "Q19.2" ~ "SupportSatisfaction",
                        question == "Q17"   ~ "Training",
                        question == "Q22.1" ~ "TrainingWhere",
                        question == "Q22.2" ~ "TrainingSatisfaction"
  )) %>%
  
  # Create new "item_group" variable reflecting visual grouping of items in the survey questionnaire (groups in survey were not labelled). This could potentially be used to break up items in graphs. 
  
  mutate(item_group = case_when(
                        item %in% c("1","2","3","4","5","6","7") ~ 'Group 1',
                        item %in% c("8","9","10","11","12","13","14","15") ~ 'Group 2',
                        item %in% c("16","17","18","19","20","21") ~ 'Group 3',
                        item %in% c("22","23","24","25") ~ 'Group 4',
                        TRUE ~ 'other'
  )) %>%                      
  
  
  mutate (item = case_when(
                        item == '1' ~ 'Project management',
                        item == '2' ~ 'Study/data design',

## Create dataframes for graphs

 - create `short_response` field for legends
 - remove `other` fields
 - Identify set of responses that items in graph should be sorted by (these are assigned value of "1" in the `sort_include` variable)

```{r}
graph_data <- pivot3 %>%
  mutate(short_response = str_match(response, "(.*)(support|training)")[,1]) %>%
  drop_na(short_response) %>%
  filter(item != "Other") %>%
  mutate(sort_include = if_else(str_starts(short_response,"I would have liked")|str_starts(short_response, "I sought additional"),1,0))
```

# Overall "need for training/support" graph
```{r}

# `item` ordered by totals of `sort_include` variable
graph_data$item <- fct_reorder(graph_data$item,graph_data$sort_include,sum)

overall_graph <- graph_data %>%
  filter(question == "Support"|question == "Training") %>%
  mutate(response = str_match(response,"(.*(additional|liked))")[,2]) %>%
  mutate(response = str_replace(response,"liked","liked*")) %>%
  group_by(item_group,item,short_response) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(y=item, fill=response))+
    geom_bar() +
    labs(y="",x="# of respondents", fill="", title="Support and training by topic: all topics", subtitle="All topics selected by at least one survey respondent", caption="* I would have liked support/training but did not know it was available")+
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Greens")+
    facet_wrap(vars(question)) +
